# Basic Scatter Plot
This project is an lab activity of CSC-395 Data Visualization [lab webpage](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~curtsinger/teaching/2017S/CSC395/labs/10.transitions.html).

In this project, I implemented(methods I learned):

  + Transition method to make the visulization effect smooth
```js
.transition()
```
  + Remove method to remove the div after fading away
```js
.remove()
```
