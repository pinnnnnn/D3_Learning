# Basic Scatter Plot
This project is an extension of CSC-395 Data Visualization [lab webpage](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~curtsinger/teaching/2017S/CSC395/labs/08.scatter-plot.html).

In this project, I implemented(methods I learned):

1. x and y axis by using d3.scaleLinear() function and calling xaxis/yaxis method.

2. Interactive mouse over function by using 

  + on("mouseover", function(d)) to impelement the mouseover,and
  
  + on("mouseout", function(d)) to let it fade away.
